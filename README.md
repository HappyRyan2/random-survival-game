# Random Survival Game
This is a game in which you control a stick figure, dodging random obstacles in a 2d platformer setting. The objective of the game is to get a high score, which is done by surviving a high number of deadly random events. Players can also collect coins, which allow them to buy items from the shop. They can also earn achievements by satisfying certain criteria. Game details:
 - There are 16 random things to survive
 - There are 6 shop items to buy, each with 3 upgrades (except for one of them, which only has 1 upgrade)
 - There are 9 achievements to work toward
