CHANGELOG
version 1.0

* Random events (gameplay) - come every 5 seconds, take around 5 seconds to complete:
    * Lasers - a crosshair appears, teleports around randomly, centers on player, blinks, then explodes
	* Rising acid (with moving screen).
	* Boulders - They bounce off the platforms.
	* Spinning blades (they appear at the center of each platform, and take up all the space).
	* Jumping pirhanas (they jump up in sets of 3 from the bottom of the screen).
	* Giant pac-men (they come in sets of 2, one from each side of the screen. One takes up the top half, another the bottom. Very slow.)
	* Rockets - they shoot at you from the sides of the screen.
	* Spike balls - unaffected by gravity, they bounce off the edges of the screen.
	* Blindness - you can't see!
	* Confusion - left goes right, right goes left. Jump is still up.
 * Shop:
	* "Piggy Bank of Money" - more money
	* "Potion of Jumpiness" - higher jumps
	* "Boots of Speediness" - run faster
   	* "Talisman of Intangibility" - walk through walls
	* "Skull of Reanimation" - extra lives
