# random-survival-game
Simple browser (HTML / JavaScript) game in which you control a stick figure, dodging random obstacles in a 2d platformer setting.
 * To run, open the file 'randomSurvival.html'. Runs in your browser.
 * I don't really want contributions (I basically just put my projects online so other people can see them) but feedback is welcome. If you want to fork it, I guess you can, but pull requests will likely be ignored.
